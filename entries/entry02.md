# Entry 2

In my last blog, I talked about what I learned, what I considered doing and how I tried to learn to make a 3D figure. In this blog, I will be talking about what I tried doing, how I faced some of the challenges in learning new code, and what I did to know them/ have them in mind. I will talk about my plans to keep working on this during the winter break. I will also talk about how three.js had a very big impact on this. 

### New things I have learned:

` THREE.BoxGeometry();`

BoxGeometry is a geometry class for a rectangular cuboid with a given 'width', 'height', and 'depth'. On creation, the cuboid is centered on the origin, with each edge parallel to one of the axes. THREE.BoxGeometry. width. Height. 

.

I have also learned another way that allows you to specify whether or not a variable is modifiable.
`const` 

Which works similar like a variable.
