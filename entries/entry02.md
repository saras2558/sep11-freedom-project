In my last blog, I talked about what I learned, what I considered doing and how I tried to learn to make a 3D figure. In this blog, I will be talking about what I tried doing, how I faced some of the challenges in learning new code, and what I did to know them/ have them in mind. I will talk about my plans to keep working on this during the winter break. I will also talk about how three.js had a very big impact on this. 

### New things I have learned:

` THREE.BoxGeometry();`

BoxGeometry is a geometry class for a rectangular cuboid with a given 'width', 'height', and 'depth'. On creation, the cuboid is centered on the origin, with each edge parallel to one of the axes. THREE.BoxGeometry. width. Height.

.

I have also learned another way that allows you to specify whether or not a variable is modifiable.
`const` 
Which works similar like a variable `Var`

.
.

Math. sin() method returns a numeric value between -1 and 1, which represents the sine of the angle given in radians. Because sin() is a static method of Math , you always use it as Math! 

.
.

A 3D vector is an ordered triplet of numbers (labeled x, y, and z), which can be used to represent a number of things, such as: A direction and length in 3D space. ... In three.

I was wondering what `THREE.Mesh` would do. I searched it up on google and read multiple articles, but for short: A mesh is an object that takes a geometry, and applies a material to it, which we then can insert to our scene, and move freely around. By default, when we call a scene.

### What I tried on the website
