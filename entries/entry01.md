I was thinking of creating a 3D
* Illusion 

Or 
* Heart 

for this freedom project.
But I settled on one, which is a heart. I'll be writing code to create a 3D heartbeat. I might add some effects, such as blood or a knife. I chose this tool after researching [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and finding it to be the most appealing. More than any of the other tools or initiatives. I checked at the [code](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)Â for creating a scene and thought it was quite cool. I plan to put my basic coding abilities to use while learning new codes.
