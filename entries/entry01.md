# Entry 1
##### 11/8/2021

On the first day of this project, I looked at numerous tools, and the one that peaked my interest the most was games. Make whatever games you want and mold them anyway you want. I decided to first try making a game, one that was both entertaining and informative. After a few weeks, I changed my mind since a game seemed just too difficult to do at the time. As a result, I had a backup plan. 3D. I thought it was pretty cool after looking at many 3D programs and websites.

The first tool that caught my interest and which I chose is [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). There are several tools that appear to be cool, as well as numerous games and codes. It was my original option, with a backup plan to do a calendar if things became too difficult. I had two possibilities for what I could do with three.js in terms of 3D.


* Illusion


Or, 

* A heart

And after considerable deliberation, I concluded that a heart, a beating heart, would be cooler. I'd add some sort of effect, like blood or a knife. I will try to include anything that could be added. I looked at the code for constructing a scene (https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and thought it was quite nice. Pretty hard to learn but with many videos, I think I have got it. And that is one skill I will be using. Learning to design things on my own, learning new code, and eventually doing it on my own with help if needed. I'll use my basic coding abilities and understanding of some code.

My engineering design process is now focused on learning how to write new and 3D codes. I discovered a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exQ43PFWJBU) that is really informative and will help me get started. However, this Three.js [Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org/) website also helped me in learning a new code.

```
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
```
To create a scene, and a Scene in three.js is the root of a form of scene graph.
