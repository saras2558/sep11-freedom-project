# Entry 6
##### 6/1/2022

## Context 

In my last blog, I talked about my MVP and what I needed to do next. Days have gone by and I finished my touches, presenting it in the Expo and in class. 

In this blog, I will reflect on both presentations, takeaways, and how everything went. I will also talk about what I need to improve for next time and the finishing touches I made.

### Last touches 
Although I did change how much of what my project looked like. I did change the distance between the hearts. 

I wanted to make it look more neat and better. So I changed it a lot…like a lot. I first used ‘math.random’ to make the hearts display at random places with random sizes. 

However, that looked a bit messy and some of the hearts were colliding on top of each other. So I changed the numbers and made it more neat. 

```JS

for (var i=-window.innerWidth/2; i<window.innerWidth/2; i+=100){ // for the wdith 
			    for (var l=0; l<window.innerHeight; l+=120 ){ // up and down
			      addShape( heartShape,  settings, 'red',   i, l, 0, 0.8, 1.9, Math.PI, 0.4 );
			    }
			  }
        
 ```
 
This code simply shows how the heart is being displayed. It’s almost like the setting but different by the numbers. 

This was the most change I made. I did not change the speed or how the heart looked. 

### Takeaways from giving Expo elevator pitch (presenting)

I was sitting at the second table and waiting for my turn. To present my presentation. I did memorize my elevator pitch before but I knew that my mind would go blank as soon as the Judges came to me. 

When it was my turn, I first said hi and began my elevator pitch. First, introducing myself and the tool I used, three.js. 

### Takeaways from giving Expo elevator pitch (presenting)

I was sitting at the second table and waiting for my turn. To present my presentation. I did memorize my elevator pitch before but I knew that my mind would go blank as soon as the Judges came to me. 

When it was my turn, I first said hi and began my elevator pitch. First, introducing myself and the tool I used, three.js. 

I talked about what three.js is and how it is used mostly in 3D. Then I talked about what my project is about and how it looks. 

I can see one of the judges was interested but the other kept looking away. It taught me, next time, to speak louder and to engage with the audience that might lose interest. 

I told them the purpose, which was to entertain and it’s amazing for Valentine’s Day!!

One of the judges said that it was cool and looked good. 

My other takeaway is that this presentation was fast. I couldn’t say why I chose three.js and how hard yet beautiful it is. So next time, I should’ve made my presentation short yet spoke only the importance of it. 

Another takeaway is speaking louder!! 

Since it was in the cafeteria, people were speaking all over and there was music from other presentations. Next time, I will speak as loud as I can so that almost the whole table can hear!

Although this presentation was quick and I missed out on important things, next time I will do better but this was a fun experience and the first time I presented to a judges. 


### Takeaways from giving in-class presentation

When I stood up and faced everyone, I felt this nerve and my heart almost dropped. I knew what I had to say and I practiced. However, the word flew from my mind as soon as I said hi to the class. 

I first presented the hook. Which was really hard to do since my project was really simple, at least the overall is shown simple but the code was NOT. I then talked about what I used, three.js, to make my project. 

Since the code was really hard to explain and I always had difficulty explaining it. I took one of the explanations from the website, three.js. 

This was one of my takeaways. I needed to put my own words and explain the code in my own words. Next time, for sure, I will type words that I understand and explain the code better in my own words. 

My other takeaway is that I needed to give more energy while presenting and look more excited. I think because I was very nervous that I couldn't breathe caused me to look down. Plus, it was morning! 

However, next time I'll keep these two takeaways in mind!!

One of my other takeaways is learning how to write a hook. Although it was very hard to write my hook. I need to think more on how to engage the reader, while looking more excited and energetic.

### Skills: 

The skills I used during this project are googling and google tricks. Googling helped me pick a nice frame presentation. [Slides go](https://slidesgo.com/) was a great website that gives free theme slides.

I also used copy and paste (command C), selecting all (Command A), and many others that helped me with my time and made it easier to work with computers. 


### Engineering design process:

For my engineering design process, I think I am around 8. I am done with my project and all my presentations. This includes the result and the end! :)

Next time, I will need to work on my time management. This project was taking most of my time which was difficult since I had many exams and SAT. However, I needed to give this as much time as I could since it was very important.
