# Entry 4
##### 3/20/2022

In my last entry, I wrote about how I started taking baby steps at first. Learning my tool first, step by step is key before coding it. However, I realized that time is passing by fast. So, I need to do bare minimum (mvp) 

I needed to spend more time on writing down the basics so I could make a shape---at least. 

Since I learned some of the basics. Like knowing how to create a scene and simple shapes. I wanted to learn how to do more. 

I went straight to learning about textures of the shape. And there were SO many mapping modes and codes. I had to search it all up to understand it all. 

Here was some of the codes I found on this [page](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/constants/Textures) 

``` js
THREE.UVMapping
THREE.CubeReflectionMapping
THREE.CubeRefractionMapping
THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping
THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping
THREE.CubeUVReflectionMapping
THREE.CubeUVRefractionMapping

```
