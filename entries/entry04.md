## Context

In my last entry, I wrote about how I started taking baby steps at first. Learning my tool first, step by step is key before coding it. However, I realized that time is passing by fast. So, I need to do bare minimum (mvp) 

I needed to spend more time on writing down the basics so I could make a shape---at least. 

Since I learned some of the basics. Like knowing how to create a scene and simple shapes. I wanted to learn how to do more. 

I went straight to learning about textures of the shape. And there were SO many mapping modes and codes. I had to search it all up to understand it all. 

Here was some of the codes I found on this [page](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/constants/Textures) 

``` js
THREE.UVMapping
THREE.CubeReflectionMapping
THREE.CubeRefractionMapping
THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping
THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping
THREE.CubeUVReflectionMapping
THREE.CubeUVRefractionMapping

```

These define the texture's mapping mode.
`UVMapping` is the default, and maps the texture using the mesh's UV coordinates.

There were also wrapping modes, which appertanly define horizontal and vertical texture wrapping. 

These were just confusing!! So I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l77yAZ0E950) which helped a lot. They basically explained everything but also they showed how it works by doing a figure. 

During these weeks, I have also been learning where I should start my code. Other than just coding in the small boxes in the website [three.js](https://threejs.org/). I wanted to learn and know where I should apply my code. 


I could use my regular IDE. But I also found more like [this](https://threejs.org/editor/):

Or [this](https://jsfiddle.net/) which has some code for a figure already:

These are just ideas. However, I think using my IDE is the safest place to start my code.

## Skills:

I learned many computer tricks but I think the most important one is how I could get the tab back if I close it, without going to my history and just pressing a few keyboards. Ctrl,  shift, T. Which helped me alot, since I do have multiple tabs and activity delete one.  

There is also organization. I organize my tab by putting it into categories or groups like shown in this photo:

This. I learned from Mr. Mueller :) 

## Engineering design process: 

I think I am around 3 or 4 because I’m still trying to figure out multiple solutions. I also did a timeline plan but I was still unsure how it would go. March is here and I need to start coding at least one line of code. So as I’m writing this, I am taking the first step into coding the basics.
