## Context 

In my last blog, I talked about learning the texture of the shape and how I wanted---needed--- to start coding. For my MVP (The bare minimum), I created 3D heart shapes that go across the screen, while slowly spinning around. 

Although I don’t like how it looks now, I am still working on making it better till the deadline. 

My code took forever!! There were errors, challenges, and lack of understanding of some of the code. 

### Let’s break the code apart: 

Before I could start coding and shaping my shape. I needed to create an index file with the starter code. I had trouble finding the “script src” for three.js code. I asked Mr. Mueller and he suggested this [website](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/three.js/r128) which was so helpful (because if I put all this [lines of code](https://threejs.org/build/three.js), the IDE would literally crash) 

Then, I needed to create a scene (the first code of three.js). In three.js, I needed a div, an append child (for the container or box), THREE.Scene(), THREE.PerspectiveCamera(), and much more that I was not expecting. 

I used this [page](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene), which was the most helpful in learning what I needed to start coding. It explains what each code meant and it adds a cube (that I showed in my last blog).
