# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Sara Saleh

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about learning a new JavaScript tool and creating an interactive program using a JS library, framework, etc. The purpose of these blogs is to serve as a way to thoroughly illustrate my growth, challenges, and takeaways working towards my project. 

## Content
For my project, I am making 3D hearts. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying three.js in order to make 3D heart figures.

## Implications

### Global: 
Environment: This project could help make other 3D shapes for economic issues, which could help see problems clearly and solve them. 


### Social: 
Individual: Good way to look at and entertain yourself! 


Relationships: This is great for valentines day which could be presented to show love. This doesn’t have to be for valentines day only, it could also be a way to show love. 


Cultures: Great way to show love for culture 


### Economics: 
Jobs: 3D shapes, hearts, are great for designing an advertisement. It’s also a great way to see what the design is before applying it to real life. This helps jobs such as designing shoes, jewelry, or anything in particular.
